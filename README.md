# Overview

This is a basic Hello World program. I created this to demonstrate the use of Visual Studio Code, GitHub, and Python integrated together.

This program prints "Hello, World!" in 14 different languages:
* English
* Chinese
* Hindi
* Spanish
* French
* Arabic
* Bengali
* Portuguese
* Russian
* Urdu
* Morse Code
* Klingon
* Sign Language
* Elvish

My purpose in creating this software was to integrate Visual Studio Code, GitHub, and Python. I adapted the classic Hello World program by including multiple languages for a signature flair. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}
